Hi there! My name is Wellison Maia, and I live in Brazil. Currently I am a Information System undergraduate student at IFAL. And also i've been studying Data Science and Machine Learning at Alura.
 
Nowadays I work as a technical support of a local company, but I am looking for my dream, which is my first job in the area of Science and Data Analysis.
